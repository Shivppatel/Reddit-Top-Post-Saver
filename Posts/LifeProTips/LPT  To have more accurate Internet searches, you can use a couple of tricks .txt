Another trick:

Stop using Google for your searches and start using Bing.

I know this sounds crazy.. but Google now blocks all kinds of things and heavily favors paid advertisers in it's results. Videos won't show up if there is copyright infringement.. as well as a few other things. Bing has none of these filters. 

Bing video searches are fantastic for porn, FYI..lol.

Hopefully someone will thank me for this later haha
