I actual do a journal for this reason. I try to do it everyday, which rarely happens, but once I got into the habit I always remember to record the important stuff. 2 years on, its actually pretty cool to go back and read what you’ve written. 

I’m a guy, and I’m not the sentimental type generally speaking, but journaling has actually been therapeutic and helpful for me.

This is a legitimately helpful LPT. It should have more upvotes.

I wish I journaled. I have software and an app but don’t. This is good advice. Also save compliments in email. 

I was amusing thinking of these emails:
Got married today. 
Graduated college today
Had baby. 

Anyway, in college, I sent letters to my parents almost weekly. One of the primary reasons was to keep a journal. I knew if I did it in software, it could get lost or deleted. I knew my parents would hang onto my letters and they did.

Why would I use emails to leave myself notes?  Use Google Docs or something else like it.
