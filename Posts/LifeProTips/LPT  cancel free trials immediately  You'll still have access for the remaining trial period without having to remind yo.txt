	LPT: cancel free trials immediately. You'll still have access for the remaining trial period without having to remind yourself to cancel towards the end.

Apple TV year long trial will terminate the service immediately upon cancellation.  So what you are saying is not always the case.

I literally just installed Premiere yesterday to finish my film final, picked the monthly service that comes with a free week trial, submitted my film and then immediately cancelled, and now I don’t have the ability to use Premiere. 

So this isn’t true for that at least lol

Or use a calendar.

Does not work with Hulu. They cancel the trial immediately.

use privacy.com to make a credit card, where you can put a limit on how much $ is spent on it. then you never need to worry about cancelling as they eventually charge a card and it denies it

This is not good advice, as many many many vendors have become wise to this and will immediately cancel the trial period if you don't keep an active card on.

Yeah I did that with Hulu and immediately lost access to Hulu...you’re better off setting a calendar alert for the day *before* the free trial ends and canceling it then.
