I've always thought how great an idea it would be to find a mentor. It seems like the most fool-proof way to learn a great deal about a craft while also securing a job.

Edit: I have just learned "fool-proof" is not "full proof" haha

Nothing against the idea, but I don't think having a single life experience plus a bunch of reinforcing comments is a reliable source. Considering this is a life-changing (for better or worse) advice, it is actually pretty dangerous.
