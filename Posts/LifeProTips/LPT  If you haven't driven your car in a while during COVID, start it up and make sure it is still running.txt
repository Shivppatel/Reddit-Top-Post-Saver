Don't just start it though. You get it just warm enough to create condensation, but not hot enough to burn off that condensation. If you start it, get it up to normal operating temp. Otherwise just put a battery tender on it.

How long can you keep a car on a battery tender?

Can confirm, just replaced my battery

Always try and drive it a couple times a week so it doesn’t sit, also unplugging any electronics that could be left plugged in, especially with older cars. Newer cars not so much!

Oil can sometimes go bad as well if you haven't driven in a bit. Cars that sit around need their oil changed too.
