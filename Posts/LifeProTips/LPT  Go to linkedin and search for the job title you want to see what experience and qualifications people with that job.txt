Nice one! Back when I was in college, LinkedIn wasn’t even fully established. I had to research the Internet for people’s resumes and bios who had the careers/jobs I wanted.  I use LinkedIn today for this purpose.

The person with the job I want has the same surname as the company owner so should I change my surname too?

Just making sure I understand this correctly:  


Say I wanted to do what System Engineers do and get a job as a Junior SysEngineer, I should just search for "System Engineer" in the LinkedIn Search and see what those people with the same title are doing/have experience in?
