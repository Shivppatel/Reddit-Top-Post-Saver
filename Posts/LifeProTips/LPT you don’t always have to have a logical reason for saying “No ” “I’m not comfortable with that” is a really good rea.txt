	LPT you don’t always have to have a logical reason for saying “No.” “I’m not comfortable with that” is a really good reason.

This gets easier with age. As I've gotten older I've noticed that I've become a grumpy old bastard that has no problem saying no

As someone who has learned to say no - most of the time just saying no or that wont work for me is enough for the other person to accept it

I always remember the time I was \~10 and had a friend\* invite me over, and I told my mom.  The way I told her, she clearly figured out I didn't actually want to go, and she told me I was allowed to say no even if I didn't have a reason, and it was like an epiphany.

My BIL taught me this lesson. If you don’t want to do something- don’t. 

Learning to say no is one of the hardest lessons.

It’s gets easier the more you say it and your tone adjusts as well.

Reading that request in your post - current middle aged me was like, hell no! I often need to pause and hold a bit back.

I’m probably going to be a rude old woman with no filter, judging by how I am now.

Early twenties me would likely have needed the, ‘I’m not comfortable with that’, because I still cared a lot about people’s opinion of me. I tended to over explain and give people openings to push.

The sooner you learn the power of no, the better.
