Get drunk and tell your secret to yourself. That way you'll be too drunk to remember in the morning even though you'll have told someone that can essentially be trusted.

Also, never tell secrets when some shares them with you, but remeber hem and use as blackmail when needed.

A secret is only a secret when it is between two people; and one of them is dead...

Get them on your side by making them think people tell you a lot of secrets too, but lie about whatever "secret" you tell them. Make sure it sounds believable.

Watch things collapse as they start telling lies about others, then expose them at the most crucial moment, exposing how they spread secrets as well.

Those who aren't trustworthy would do well to not be gullible.

If you are going to blabber about your own secrets then you probably can’t be trusted with anyone else’s either.
