Here are a couple of reasons I can think of off the top.

* self protection
* others' protection
* punishment for ass-kicking reasons, like he killed my cat

I'm sure there are a hundred others.

Immediately after their infraction so they will associate the arse kicking with the mistake they made.

Only when defending yourself.  

There are better options on the attack.

When they have kicked your donkey first, then I would say it is appropriate to kick their donkey. As everyone knows, a donkey represents the pride of your family, and therefore must be defended.
