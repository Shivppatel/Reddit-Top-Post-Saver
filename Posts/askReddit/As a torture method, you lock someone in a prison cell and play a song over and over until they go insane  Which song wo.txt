	As a torture method, you lock someone in a prison cell and play a song over and over until they go insane. Which song would be most effective?

Y'all or doing this all wrong, any song will drive someone crazy-- 

the trick to effective torture is to go on their phone and use their most played and favorite song; then I'm not only torturing them but also ruining something they love

I don't mean to brag but I'm middle management at Comcast so this is kinda right in my wheelhouse

A very short one.

The shorter it is, the more repetition.
