I thought of the question because I want to the world to see my answer, so it would be a waste of a question if I didnâ€™t answer it

I don't usually have a problem with that, especially if you want to share a relevant story that goes along with the question to get conversations going.  The one's that are weird, though, are the people who gild themselves right after asking a question.  Now that's asking for backlash and trying to seek negative attention.
