The first Sonic the Hedgehog for Genesis. My cousin had it so he introduced me to Sonic, Mortal Kombat, and all kinds of other shit that's now classic.

Zelda II: The Adventure of Link

I actively dislike the game now (but I kind of admire what it was going for), but I was absolutely *enthralled* with it from the word "go".

The Demo disc that came with the PS1. It was a Christmas gift and my mom didn’t know you had to buy games separately, lol.

This whole thread is making me feel a lot less old than I thought I felt.  Thanks for that.

First gen Nintendo will always have a special place in my heart.
