	A tool that copies a selected area of your screen, not as a picture, but as pastable text (GitHub in comments)

Not a particularly complex program, as the OCR backend uses Google's Tesseract engine, but I hope it can be useful!

I can see a market for this - from blocked pdf files to a word doc

This is cool work. I implemented a very similar concept to create an e-mail listener that automates database lookup requests from co-workers who refuse to type out details, but rather paste them inline in e-mails as picture snippets.   

I like your application, I think a great next step could be copying multiple pieces of text/lines of text to different clipboard hotkeys, so copying and pasting 3-5 individual lines instead of typing all of it out would be possible. Could definitely be a godsend for people doing arduous data entry tasks if you're interested in doing that. Either way, good work.

You can also do this with OneNote. Cool program though!

Similar to Project Naptha which allows highlighting text in images it also has a chrome extension https://projectnaptha.com

Doesn't work on multiple monitors.

I have three screens,the left having my IDE, the center having a browser open, the right having iterm.  After running, the screen goes black.  If I click and drag, it copies from the center monitor even though it's clicking and dragging on a blank screen from the right monitor.

Otherwise, it's pretty kick ass.
