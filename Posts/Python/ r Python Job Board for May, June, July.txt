**Python (Django) Web Developer Required**

**Remote Working**

I am looking to find a Python (Django) Web Developer. I paid for the development of a Background Check application a few years ago, which is pretty much all built in Django, CSS & Javascript. It was made available over the web and mobile. In addition to the public sites, a task-driven back office interface for use by multiple users was set up. The code has had no development on it in quite a while, but I now need some help unravelling the it, to get the core application working again. No prior experience is required with Background Checks systems is required. We are looking for good experience with Python (Django), along with associated CSS & JavaJavascript. You must have had experience developing applications with sign-up, login (password authentication), integrating payment facilities, automated email, integration with third party APIs, logging for auditing purposes. You will be required to sign an NDA to be considered for this job. Good English language skills are ESSENTIAL. If anyone is interested, please could you send me some examples of your work or a CV?

**Remote Side Hustle Gig: Create blogs and videos using our Platform**  
We're looking for a few developers to help build out our blog and write about scripts they build using our platform called WayScript. WayScript is a rapid development platform built for developers. 

These blog posts you would write are short and explain simple everyday concepts using WayScript. *Examples: Web scraping using Python, scheduling Python scripts to run daily, copying SQL data to Google sheets, creating a slack notification when your Github repo has a new commit, etc.*

If you like to build tools, develop scripts, etc and also like to teach other devs how you did it, please PM me. Visit the "Learn" section of our website to see examples. If you also like creating videos, that's a bonus. This is a "gig" job where we would pay an agreed flat fee for each post or video you create, you can work at your leisure and could be a long term side hustle for you.
