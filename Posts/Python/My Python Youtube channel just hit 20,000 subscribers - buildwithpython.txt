Wow, that's amazing. I've just started sharing videos for [http://tinypythonprojects.com/](http://tinypythonprojects.com/) when I needed to pre-record my class lectures for my students this semester. I aspire to anything over a few hundred subscribers! Let me know if you'd like me to contribute a lesson or something!

What is the name of your channel, during the quarantine I become interested in programming.

Cool! I wrote scripts to scan networks  and for easy encryption, but never built too much with it. Started in web development, and after learning JavaScript, I'm interested in getting back into python.
So I'll be checking out your channel.

Congratulations. So how was your process when you started? You would learn something about python and then make a video out of it?
