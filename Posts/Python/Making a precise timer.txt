Hello! I'm a bot!

It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, 
a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python **regardless of how advanced your question might be**. 
That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell.
Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster.

Show /r/learnpython **the code you have tried and describe in detail where you are stuck.** 
If you are getting an error message, include the full block of text it spits out.
Quality answers take time to write out, and many times other users will need to ask clarifying questions. Be patient and help them help you. 
**[Here is HOW TO FORMAT YOUR CODE For Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** 
and be sure to include which version of python and what OS you are using.


You can also ask this question in the [Python discord](https://discord.gg/3Abzge7), 
a large, friendly community focused around the Python programming language, open to those who wish to learn the language 
or improve their skills, as well as those looking to help others.
